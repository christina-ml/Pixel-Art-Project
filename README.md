## The Pixel Art Maker

Make your own pixel art using the Pixel Art Maker! Change the grid size. Change the color. Save your favorite color's Hex number to go back to use it again, while you create your masterpiece. Click "Submit" again to clear the grid, and restart. Take a screenshot to save your artwork.
